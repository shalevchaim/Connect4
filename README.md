# Connect4
This is a Connect 4 game implemented in React and Python using Flask (with socketio) NPM and Webpack

### Pre-requirements
- Install npm, webpack, flask

### To get started
_I used virtualenv to run my python server._
_I like to run the first 2 steps as a background process using nohup commands &_
1. `python ./server/server.py`
2. run `npm run watch`
3. Go to http://localhost:5000 in browser
4. The rest should be self explanitory, but just in case, you can send the link of a new game to a friend to play in real time.
